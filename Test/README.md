# Printf Project

## Table of Content


## Project Overview
The Printf Project is a tailored reimplementation of the standard C library function printf. Its purpose is to replicate the functionality of printf by supporting selected format specifiers, while also providing developers with a deeper understanding of variadic functions and low-level system calls.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
* Strengthen understanding of C programming concepts such as variadic functions, memory allocation, and system calls.
* Build a foundational understanding of how standard library functions are implemented.
* Foster collaboration through team-based development.

### Main Features
* Custom implementation of the _printf_ function.
* Support for a subset of printf conversion specifiers.
* Extensive testing to ensure reliability and consistency.

### Intended Audience
This project is designed for:
* Holberton students learning the intricacies of C programming.
* Developers interested in understanding how functions like _printf_ are implemented under the hood.

## Supported Specifiers

### What is a format specifier?
A format specifier is a special sequence of characters used in formatted input and output functions (like printf, scanf) to define how data should be formatted and displayed or read.

| Format Specifier | Description                               | Example Output       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| %c               | Prints a single character                 | Input: %c -> H       |
| %s               | Prints a string of characters             | Input: %s -> Hello   |
| %                | Prints a literal % character              | Input: %% -> %       |

### Compilation Instructions
All the files that were used are compiled using:
'gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c'

## Language
The implementation of the _printf()_ function is being carried out in the C programming language. As a low-level language, C provides the flexibility to construct and manage funtions from the ground up, allowing us to precisely define their behavior and outputs. At this stage, we are still building our foundational knowledge of C, and this projects serves as a practical exercise to reinforce our understanding by recreating _printf()_ entirely from scratch.
